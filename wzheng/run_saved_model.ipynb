The term generally applies to the restoration of native ecosystems. Any project that aims to repair degraded land must have clear goals. This entry refers to success and completion criteria for restoration. It includes a case study of the restoration of a eucalyptus forest after mining to demonstrate the level of success and the completion criteria that have been used in a major project that is restoring around 500 ha of forest each year.\",\n          \"Physical protection by soil aggregates stabilizes soil organic carbon under simulated N deposition in a subtropical forest of China Atmospheric N deposition has increased dramatically in China due to rapid industrial, agricultural, and urban development, greatly affecting carbon cycling. While C emissions may increase by elevated N deposition, limitation in the accessibility of substrates to decomposers within soil aggregates may dampen soil microbial activity, and thereby physically protect organic carbon from decomposition. In this study, we explore whether physical protection by soil aggregates could stabilize soil organic carbon, thereby dampening C loss rates. To do this, we applied additional nitrogen deposition of 0, 50, 100, 200 and 300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (3 replicate 10 m x 10 m plots of each) to a Schima plantation in southeast China. Several soil parameters and microbial biomass C and N in bulk soil, as well as in different soil aggregate size fractions (0.25-1 mm, 1-2 mm, 2-5 mm and 5-8 mm) were analyzed. With increasing N deposition, the total nitrogen (TN), electrical conductivity (EC) and NH4+-N increased, pH and C/N decreased, and soil organic carbon (SOC) did not change both in bulk soil and soil aggregates. In bulk soil, regression analysis revealed that simulated N deposition-led to a significant decrease in microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and an increase in microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), while no alterations were observed for SOC, dissolved organic C (DOC) and hot-water extracted organic C (HWOC). In soil aggregates, regression analysis revealed that MBC in 0.25-1 mm aggregate size fraction and MBN in 1-2 mm and 5-8 mm aggregate size fractions significantly decreased with an increase of N deposition, while DOC in 0.25-1 mm and 2-5 mm aggregate size fractions significantly increased with increasing N deposition. No significant alterations in SOC and HWOC were observed with simulated N deposition for all aggregate size fractions. However, both DOC and HWOC in all aggregate size fractions were significantly greater compared to that of bulk soil. More specifically, MBN in soil aggregates were 61.79%-69.86% less than in bulk soil (p < 0.05), MBC in 1-2 mm, 25 mm and 5-8 mm aggregate size fractions was 20.69%, 15.74% and 1336% less than in bulk soil, respectively. Concentrations of DOC, HWOC and MBC/MBN in soil aggregates were 41.02%-66.40%, 91.30%-104.45% and 151.09%-165.22% greater than in bulk soil (p < 0.05), respectively. The ratios of DOC/SOC and HWOC/SOC in soil aggregates were 37.99%-86.03% and 80.51%-140.77% greater than bulk soil, respectively. These results demonstrated that physical protection by soil aggregates decreased microbial activity, which impeded SOC decomposition and resulted in higher DOC, HWOC concentrations and their proportions in SOC compared to bulk soil. However, as the levels of DOC and HWOC were very low compared to SOC, simulated N deposition did not impact SOC in the short time of this experiment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this entry, we reviewed the level of soil degradation and the loss of SOC in Ethiopia. Results of studies on land use types are summarized to sort out those sound types that can potentially reverse the SOC loss in various ecosystems of the country. The SOC loss through soil erosion, deforestation, and land use change is estimated to be from 15 to 1000 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in Ethiopia. Much of this loss in SOC can be attributed to reduced inputs of organic matter, increased decomposability of crop residues, and tillage effects that decrease the amount of physical protection to decomposition. The problem of SOC depletion in Ethiopia can be tackled through better management aimed at augmenting the normal function of the soils and SOC sequestration. Land use types such as native forest, grass land, plantation forest, agroforestry, and woodlands better protect the soil from severe erosion and augment the accrual of SOC. Restoration of severely degraded lands through area closure is good option to enhance SOC sequestration if it is practiced in areas where the soil depth class falls below 35 cm. We suggest that appropriate policy should be launched to safeguard very sloppy lands from cultivation. Along with biological and physical conservation measures, cow dung and crop residues should be returned to the cultivated crop fields to enhance the sequestration of SOC and sustain agricultural productivity.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prediction_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.04172799363732338\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prediction\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
